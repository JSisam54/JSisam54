- 👋 Hi, I’m Jane @JSisam54
- 👀 I’m interested in applying machine learning and data science to animal health problems.
- 🌱 I’ve been learning python as well as ML and Data Science with Andrei and Daniel of Zero To Mastery.
- 💞️ At the present I'm applying what I know about TensorFlow and unstructured data in a project that will classify microscopic objects found in a pasture wash, as a Pithomces Chartarum spore or not.
- 📫 The ultimate goal is to create an app that makes spore counting easier and faster so farmers can make management decisions more quickly and with more confidence. Fewer cows would get facial eczema which would mean higher herd milk production in late lactation and healthier cows. I'm on the look out for others that might be interested in joining me in this project. oReach me at email: jcbarnsley54@gmail.com
